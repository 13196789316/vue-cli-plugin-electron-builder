# Vue CLI Plugin Electron Builder

A Vue Cli 3 plugin for Electron with no required configuration that uses [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) and [Electron Webpack](https://webpack.electron.build/).

Then, install and invoke the generator of vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder by running:

    vue add electron-builder

That's It! Your ready to go!

    npm run serve:electron

### To build your app:

With yarn:

    yarn build:electron

or with NPM:

### Configuration Files:

### Electron Builder:

To see avalible options, check out [Electron Builder Configuration Options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration)

As per Electron Builder's documentation, they can be applied:

> * in the `package.json` file of your project using the `build` key on the top level:
>
>
> ```
>  "build": {
>    "appId": "com.example.app"
>  }
> ```
>
> * or through the `--config <path/to/yml-or-json5-or-toml>` option (defaults to `electron-builder.yml`(or `json`, or [json5](http://json5.org/), or [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml))).
>
>
> ```
>  appId: "com.example.app"
> ```
>
> If you want to use [toml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML), please install `yarn add toml --dev`.
>
> Most of the options accept `null` â€” for example, to explicitly set that DMG icon must be default volume icon from the OS and default rules must be not applied (i.e. use application icon as DMG icon), set `dmg.icon` to `null`

### Electron Webpack:

To see avalible options, check out [Electron Webpack Configuration Options](https://webpack.electron.build/configuration)
